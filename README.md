# Knockout Validator
Under development in very early stages. Currently not really usable :).

## Thanks
Many ideas, and especially rules, are taken from the [jQuery Validation](https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation) plugin by [Jörn Zaefferer](https://github.com/jzaefferer).

## Build
To build on Windows, open up a Powershell console and run `build\build.ps1`.
