# Knockout Validator
Under development in very early stages, use at own risk!

## Thanks
Many ideas, and especially rules, are taken from the [jQuery Validation](https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation) plugin by [Jï¿½rn Zaefferer](https://github.com/jzaefferer).

## Build
The build process requires [Node](http://nodejs.org/). Make sure you have `grunt` installed:

    grunt -version

If not, install grunt: `npm install -g grunt`

To build enter the directory and type `grunt` (or `grunt.cmd`). The build version will be put in the `build/` directory.

## Licence
Nope.
